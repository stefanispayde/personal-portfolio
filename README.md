Here is my collection of the few full stack apps I have built, along with a couple of my favorite games I made online versions of. 
Choosing how I wanted my personal portfolio to look was difficult. This overall design was going to show viewers who I was as a designer 
and developer, and my choices for color scheme and font changed almost daily. What I knew I wanted from the start however,  was the a hexagon 
grid on a one page layout. After challenging myself with learning to make the honeycomb shape, I tried to think of a interesting way to click
on the hexagon, and be directed to that projects image and description. I
happened upon this <a href="https://www.codesmite.com/article/how-to-create-pure-css-hexagonal-grids">demo</a>, which helped me with some smoother 
transformations and rotations. I incorporated my own styling and placement and let it be the focal point of the site. I mirrored this design by drawing
the hexagons in Illustrator and utilizing a clipping mask to cut the picture in the same honeycomb shapes. I wanted minimal and simplistic, and that was accomplished.
