Here is my collection of the few full stack apps I have built, along with a couple of my favorite games I made online versions of. 
Choosing how I wanted my personal portfolio to look was difficult. This overall design was going to show viewers who I was, not only as a programmer, but as a designer as well. I decided to go with minimal and simplistic. My choices for color scheme and font changed almost daily, however what I knew I wanted from the start was a hexagon 
grid on a one page layout. When the user clicks one of the honeycombs, they are brought to another page with a full description and image of the apps landing page, as well as links to its code on GitHub and live site.
As of now, I'm working on building my portfolio with more apps.
